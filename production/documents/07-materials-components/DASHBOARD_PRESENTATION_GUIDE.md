## 🎯 Recommended Presentation Flow

### **Phase 1: Opening (2-3 minutes)**
**View**: Executive Dashboard

**Script**:
```
"Welcome to our Engineering BOM system for the SM100-005 Lisa Adult
Epinephrine Auto-Injector. This dashboard demonstrates our complete
traceability from raw materials to finished product, fully compliant
with ISO 13485 and FDA 21 CFR 820.

[Point to metrics]

As you can see, we have 42 components across 5 hierarchical levels,
using 8 certified materials from world-class suppliers like DuPont
and SABIC, with a total optimized weight of just 45g for patient
comfort."
```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- ✅ 42 components - Systematic approach
- ✅ 5 hierarchy levels - Complete breakdown
- ✅ 8 materials - Supply chain diversity
- ✅ 45g total weight - Patient-centric design

---

### **Phase 2: Product Structure (3-5 minutes)**
**View**: Executive Dashboard (scroll down to Product Structure Overview)

**Script**:
```
"Our product follows a modular design with two major sub-assemblies:
the Front Sub Assembly handles drug delivery components, while the
Rear Sub Assembly contains the activation mechanism.

[Point to table]

This modular approach allows us to manufacture both sub-assemblies
in parallel on different production lines, improving efficiency and
enabling independent quality testing before final assembly."
```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- ✅ Front + Rear sub-assembly design
- ✅ 7 components in front, 6 in rear
- ✅ Independent quality control
- ✅ Parallel manufacturing capability

---

### **Phase 3: Material Breakdown (2-3 minutes)**
**View**: Executive Dashboard (scroll to Material Breakdown)

**Script**:
```
"Our material selection is optimized for both performance and
regulatory compliance. PC+ABS forms the structural core at 47%
of total weight, providing excellent impact resistance and
color-coding capability for safety.

All materials are medical-grade and certified for biocompatibility
according to ISO 10993 and USP Class VI standards."
```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- ✅ PC+ABS (46.7%) - Structural components
- ✅ SUS304 (18.4%) - Medical-grade stainless steel
- ✅ POM (16%) - Low-friction moving parts
- ✅ All materials ISO 10993 compliant

---

### **Phase 4: Interactive BOM Exploration (5-10 minutes)**
**View**: Switch to BOM Tree (press `2` or click button)

**Script**:
```
"Now let me show you our complete BOM structure with full traceability.

[Click 'Expand All']

You can see the complete 5-level hierarchy from final assembly down
to individual raw materials. Each component is color-coded by level
for easy identification.

[Click on a row to collapse/expand]

We can drill down into any component to see its details - part
numbers, tool numbers, materials, suppliers, and quantities."
```

**Interactive Demo**:
1. **Expand All** → Show complete hierarchy
2. **Collapse All** → Show clean structure
3. **Click Level 1** → Expand final assembly
4. **Search "Spring"** → Show spring components with traceability
5. **Search "DuPont"** → Show all DuPont materials

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- ✅ 5-level hierarchy
- ✅ Color-coded by level
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Complete traceability

---

### **Phase 5: Supplier & Quality Compliance (3-5 minutes)**
**View**: Switch to Suppliers (press `3` or click button)

**Script**:
``"Our supply chain represents our commitment to quality and regulatory
compliance. We work with 6 certified suppliers, all ISO 13485 compliant
or equivalent.

[Point to Material Suppliers table]

For raw materials, we source from global leaders like DuPont and SABIC,
ensuring consistent material properties and full biocompatibility certification.

[Point to Component Suppliers table]

Our manufacturing partners are certified to ISO 13485, FDA 21 CFR 820,
and GMP standards, with demonstrated CPK ≥1.33 for all injection
molded parts."
```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- ✅ DuPont, SABIC, KOS Ltd. - World-class material suppliers
- ✅ Shanghai Honghui - ISO 13485 certified manufacturing
- ✅ CPK ≥1.33 quality metrics
- ✅ Full regulatory compliance (ISO, FDA, REACH, RoHS)

## 💡 Pro Tips for Common Questions

### **Q: "How do you ensure material traceability?"**
**Answer**: Click View 2 (BOM Tree) → Search "2M1" (material part numbers)
```
"We track every material from batch level to finished product using
our ERP system. As you can see, each raw material has a unique
part number (2M1xx series) that links directly to supplier batch
records and QC test results."
```

### **Q: "What is your quality control process?"**
**Answer**: View 3 (Suppliers) → Scroll to Quality Metrics
```
"Our quality control begins at supplier level - all suppliers must
maintain ISO 13485 or equivalent certification. For manufacturing,
we require CPK ≥1.33 for all injection molded parts and zero defects
for metal components. Every batch is 100% traceable."
```

### **Q: "How do you manage supply chain risk?"**
**Answer**: View 1 (Dashboard) → Scroll to Material Breakdown
```
"We mitigate supply chain risk through multiple strategies:
1. Diversified suppliers across 3 countries (China, Taiwan, USA, EU)
2. Multi-sourcing for critical materials (PC+ABS from SABIC)
3. Strategic inventory buffers for long-lead items
4. Supplier audit scores ≥90%"
```

### **Q: "Can you show me the activation mechanism?"**
**Answer**: View 2 (BOM Tree) → Expand Rear Sub Assembly
```
"The activation mechanism consists of 6 key components:
- Actuator and Actuator Sleeve (POM - low friction)
- Plunger Rod (POM - drug delivery)
- Two springs (SUS304 - reliable force)
- Rear Cap (PC+ABS - housing)

All components are color-coded in Level 4 (teal) for easy identification."
