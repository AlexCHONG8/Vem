## DHF Best Practices for Medical Device Compliance

To ensure compliance with **ISO 13485:2016** and **FDA 21 CFR 820.30**, the following best practices should be observed:

### 1. Design Control Traceability

* **Traceability Matrix**: Maintain a live matrix linking User Needs (URS) → Design Inputs (DIR/PRS) → Design Outputs (DWGs/BOM) → Design Verification (Test Reports) → Design Validation (Clinical/User Evaluation).

* Every requirement must have a corresponding verification method and result.

### 2. Risk Management Integration (ISO 14971)

* Risk management is not a one-time event. It must be integrated throughout the DHF.

* **DFMEA/PFMEA/UFMEA** should be updated whenever design changes occur.
* Ensure risk controls are verified for effectiveness.

### 3. Design Review Documentation

* Design Reviews must be conducted at appropriate stages (Phases 1-5 as shown in the table).

* Documentation must include: Date, Participants, Design version reviewed, Decisions/Action items, and Approval signatures.

### 4. Document and Revision Control

* All DHF documents must be version-controlled with a clear revision history.

* **DHF vs. DMR**: Ensure a clear distinction. The DHF is the *history* of the design (the "how" and "why"), while the DMR is the *recipe* for manufacturing the finished device.

### 5. Standardized Naming and Acronyms

* Use consistent naming conventions (like the "Short Form" column added above) to facilitate easy cross-referencing during audits.

* Always include the Document Number/ID for unique identification.
