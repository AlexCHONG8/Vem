# 3. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION

# EMERGENCY OVERVIEW

- Pellets with slight or no odor
- Spilled material may create slipping hazard
- Can burn in a fire creating dense, toxic smoke
- Molten plastic can cause severe thermal burns
- Fumes produced during melt processing may cause eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation. Severe over-exposure may result in nausea, headache, chills, and fever. See below for additional effects.
- Secondary operations, such as grinding, sanding, or sawing can produce dust which may present an explosion or respiratory hazard.

# HMIS Rating

# Health: 0

# Flammability: 1

# Reactivity: 0

Skin Contact:

Not a hazard with pellets during normal industrial use.

Eye Contact:

Resin particles, like other inert materials, are mechanically irritating to eyes.

Inhalation:

Pellet inhalation unlikely due to physical form.

Ingestion:

Pellet ingestion unlikely due to physical form.

Sensitization:

No information available on this product

Other Information:

OSHA, IARC and/or NTP have listed carbon, titanium dioxide, crystalline silica (quartz), respirable glass and certain heavy metals, present in some colorants and fillers, as carcinogens. If these materials are present in this product at significant quantities, they are shown in Section 2/3. These materials are essentially bound to the plastic matrix and are unlikely to contribute to workplace exposure under recommended processing conditions

# Chronic/Carcinogenic Information

Chronic Toxicity:

No information available

Processing Issues:

Processing vapors may cause irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. In cases of severe exposure, nausea and headache can also occur. Grease-like processing vapor condensates on ventilation ductwork, molds, and other surfaces can cause irritation and injury to skin.

Aggravated Medical Conditions:

MEDICAL RESTRICTIONS: There are no known health effects aggravated by exposure to this product. However, certain sensitive individuals and individuals with respiratory impairments may be affected by exposure to components in the processing vapors.

Product Name: HF1130-111

# 4. FIRST AID MEASURES

If Inhalation:

Move to fresh air in case of accidental inhalation of fumes from overheating or combustion. If symptoms persist, call a physician.

On skin contact:

Immediately cool the skin by rinsing with cold water after contact with hot material. Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water. Consult a physician.

On contact with eyes:

Immediately flush with plenty of water. After initial flushing, remove any contact lenses and continue flushing for at least 15 minutes. If eye irritation persists, consult a specialist.

On ingestion:

No hazards which require special first aid measures.

Precautions:

Processing vapors inhalation may be irritating to the respiratory tract. If symptoms are experienced remove victim from the source of contamination or move victim to fresh air and obtain medical advice.

# 5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

Autoignition Temperature:

$630^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (1166°F), estimated

Explosive Limits

Not determined Not determined

upper: lower:

Suitable Extinguishing Media:

Use dry chemical, CO2, water spray or "alcohol" foam. Water is the best extinguishing medium. Carbon dioxide and dry chemical are not generally recommended because their lack of cooling capacity may permit re-ignition on larger resin fires (blobs/drools/pigs etc.).

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media for Safety Reasons:

Do not use a solid water stream as it may scatter and spread fire.

Hazards from Combustion Products:

Fire will produce dense black smoke containing hazardous combustion products, carbon oxides, hydrocarbon fragments.

Special Protective Equipment for Firefighters:

Do not enter fire area without proper protection including self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective equipment. Fight fire from a safe distance and a protected location due to the potential of hazardous vapors and decomposition products.

Specific Hazards:

Take precautionary measures against static discharges. During processing, dust may form explosive mixture in air. Thermal decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors.

# 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Clean up:

Sweep up and shovel into suitable containers for disposal. Do not create a powder cloud by using a brush or compressed air.

Personal Precautions:

See section 8.

Environmental Precautions:

Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewer system. Should not be released into the environment.

When using this product at elevated temperatures, implement engineering systems, administrative controls or a respiratory protection program (including a respirator approved for protection from organic vapors, acid, gases, and particulate matter) if processing vapors are not adequately controlled or operators experience symptoms of overexposure. If dust or powder are produced from secondary operations such as sawing or grinding, use a respirator approved for protection from dust.

Body Protection:

Long sleeved clothing

Hygiene Measures:

When using, do not eat, drink or smoke.

Page 3 of 15

# Remark

1. The chemical analysis of specified SVHC is performed by means of currently available analytical techniques against the following SVHC related documents published by ECHA: <http://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table>

These lists are under evaluation by ECHA and may subject to change in the future.

1. REACH obligation:

2.1 Concerning article(s):

Communication:

Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 requires supplier of an article containing a substance meeting the criteria in Article 57 and identified in accordance with Article 59(1) in a concentration above  $0.1\%$  weight by weight  $(w / w)$  shall provide the recipient of the article with sufficient information, available to the supplier, to allow safe use of the article including, as a minimum, the name of that substance in the Candidate List.

Notification:

In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, any EU producer or importer of articles shall notify ECHA, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 7, if a substance meets the criteria in Article 57 and is identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of the Regulation, if (a) the substance in the Candidate List is present in those articles in quantities totaling over one tonne per producer or importer per year; and (b) the substance in the Candidate List is present in those articles above a concentration of  $0.1\%$  weight by weight  $(w/w)$ .

SGS adopts the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the definition of an article under REACH unless indicated otherwise. Detail explanation is available at the following link: <http://www.sgs.com/-/media/global/documents/technical-documents/technical-bulletins/sgs-crs-position-statement-on-svhc-in-articles-a4-en-16-06.pdf?la=en>

2.2 Concerning material(s):

Test results in this report are based on the tested sample. This report refers to testing result of tested sample submitted as homogenous material(s). In case such material is being used to compose an article, the results indicated in this report may not represent SVHC concentration in such article. If this report refers to testing result of composite material group by equal weight proportion, the material in each composite test group may come from more than one article.

If the sample is a substance or mixture, and it directly exports to EU, client has the obligation to comply with the supply chain communication obligation under Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 and the conditions of Authorization of substance of very high concern included in the Annex XIV of the Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006.

2.3 Concerning substance and preparation:

If a SVHC is found over  $0.1\%$  (w/w) and/or the specific concentration limit which is set in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and its amendments, client is suggested to prepare a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) against the SVHC to comply with the supply chain communication obligation under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, in which:

<table><tr><td>Batch</td><td>Substance Name</td><td>CAS No.</td><td>003 Concentration (%)</td><td>RL (%)</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>All tested SVHC in Candidate list</td><td>-</td><td>ND</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

# Notes

(1) The table above only shows detected SVHC, and SVHC that below RL are not reported. Please refer to Appendix for the full list of tested SVHC.

(2) RL = Reporting Limit (Test data will be shown if it  $\geq$  RL. RL is not regulatory limit.)

ND = Not detected (lower than RL), ND is denoted on the SVHC substance.

(3) * The test result is based on the calculation of selected element(s) and to the worst-case scenario.

** The test result is based on the calculation of selected marker(s) and to the worst-case scenario.

Calculated concentration of boric compounds are based on water extractive boron detected by ICP-OES.

Calculated concentration of Barium diboron tetraoxide is based on water extractive boron and barium

detected by ICP-OES.

$\mathrm{{RL}} = {0.005}\%$  is evaluated for element (i.e. cobalt, arsenic, lead, chromium (VI), aluminum, zirconium,

boron, strontium, zinc, antimony, titanium, barium, cadmium respectively), except molybdenum

$\mathsf{RL} = 0.0005\%$  boron  $\mathsf{RL} = 0.0025\%$  only for Lead bis(tetrafluoroborate)), fluorine RL=0.050%.

(4) § The substance is proposed for the identification as SVHC only where it contains Michler's ketone (CAS

Number: 90-94-8) or Michler's base (CAS Number: 101-61-1)  $\geq 0.1\%$  (w/w).

(5)  $I =$  Potential SVHC

(6) Composite test has been performed in equal proportion for the components/material per client requested.

And the result is calculated using the minimum sample weight.

Unless otherwise stated, the decision rule for conformity reporting is based on Binary Statement for Simple

Acceptance Rule  $(w = 0)$  stated in ILAC-G8:09/2019.
