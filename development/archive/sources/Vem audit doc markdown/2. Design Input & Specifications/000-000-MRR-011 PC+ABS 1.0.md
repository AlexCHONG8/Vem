# 2. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION

The additives in this product (if any) are bound in a thermoplastic resin matrix. In accordance with GHS for the classification of the product, the hazard potential may be assessed with respect to the physico-chemical form and/or bioavailability of the individual components in the thermoplastic resin.

Where GHS classifications are shown below, these are based on the individual components in the thermoplastic resin matrix. Under the typical use conditions for the resin, these hazardous components are unlikely to contribute to workplace exposure. Please read the entire safety data sheet and/or consult an EHS professional for a complete understanding.

# Classification

# OSHA Regulatory Status

This product is not considered hazardous by the 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200)

In 1995, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that there is "sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of carbon black." IARC's overall evaluation was that "Carbon black is possibly carcinogenic to humans (2B)." In 2006, IARC re-affirmed this classification. There has been no causal link between carbon black exposure and cancer risk in humans. Applying the rules of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling (GHS, e.g. UN 'Purple Book', EU CLP Regulation) the results of repeated dose toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in animals do not lead to classification of Carbon Black for Specific Target Organ Toxicity (Repeated exposure) and carcinogenicity. UN GHS says, that even if adverse effects are seen in animal studies or in-vitro tests, no classification is needed if the mechanism or mode of action is not relevant to humans. The European CLP Regulation also mentions, that no classification is indicated if the mechanism is not relevant to humans. Furthermore, the CLP guidance on classification and labelling states, that "lung overload" in animals is listed under mechanism not relevant to humans.

Processing Issues:

Aggravated Medical Conditions:

OSHA, IARC and/or NTP have listed carbon, titanium dioxide, crystalline silica (quartz), respirable glass and certain heavy metals, present in some colorants and fillers, as carcinogens. If these materials are present in this product at significant quantities, they are shown in Section 2/3. These materials are essentially bound to the plastic matrix and are unlikely to contribute to workplace exposure under recommended processing conditions. Processing vapors may cause irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. In cases of severe exposure, nausea and headache can also occur. Grease-like processing vapor condensates on ventilation ductwork, molds, and other surfaces can cause irritation and injury to skin.

# 5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

Autoignition Temperature: Not determined

Explosive Properties:

Avoid generating and accumulating dusts; fine dust dispersed in air in sufficient concentrations, and in the presence of an ignition source is a potential dust explosion hazard.

Suitable Extinguishing Media:

Water spray mist or foam, Use dry chemical, CO2, water spray or "alcohol" foam. Water is the best extinguishing medium. Carbon dioxide and dry chemical are not generally recommended because their lack of cooling capacity may permit re-ignition on larger resin fires (blobs, drools, etc.).

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media for Safety Reasons:

Carbon dioxide and dry chemical are not recommended because their lack of cooling capacity may permit re-ignition, Do not use a solid water stream as it may scatter and spread fire.

Hazards from Combustion Products:

Fire will produce dense black smoke containing hazardous combustion products, carbon oxides, hydrocarbon fragments, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides.

Special Protective Equipment for Firefighters:

Do not enter fire area without proper protection including self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective equipment. Fight fire from a safe distance and a protected location due to the potential of hazardous vapors and decomposition products.

Specific Hazards:

Take precautionary measures against static discharges. During processing, dust may form explosive mixture in air. Thermal decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors.

# 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Clean up: Sweep up and shovel into suitable containers for disposal. Do not create a powder cloud by using a brush or compressed air.

Personal Precautions: See section 8.

Environmental Precautions: Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewer system. Material should not be released into the environment.

# 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Handling: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practices. Provide for appropriate exhaust ventilation and dust collection at machinery. Avoid dust formation. All metal parts of the mixing and processing equipment must be earthed.

Storage: Store in closed container in a dry and cool area. Keep away from heat sources and sources of ignition.

Incompatible Products: No special restrictions on storage with other products.

# 11. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION

# Acute Toxicity

LD50/oral/rat: >5000 mg/kg

LD50/dermal/rabbit: >2000 mg/kg

Inhalation: Pellet inhalation unlikely due to physical form.

Eye Contact: Resin particles, like other inert materials, are mechanically irritating to eyes.

Skin Contact: Not a hazard with pellets during normal industrial use.

Ingestion: Pellet ingestion unlikely due to physical form.

Chronic Toxicity: No information available.

Subchronic Toxicity: No information available

Primary Irritation: Substance does not generally irritate and is only mildly irritating to the skin.

IARC: Not listed
OSHA: Not regular
NTP: Not tested

Remarks: The toxicological data has been taken from products of similar composition.

Special Studies: Carbon Black: The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that carbon black is a class 2B known animal and possible human carcinogen by the route of inhalation. Rats exposed to high doses of carbon black by inhalation developed statistically significant increases in lung fibrosis and lung tumors. Carbon Black: The scientific discussions about the carcinogenic potential of inorganic low solubility particles (fine dust) including carbon black has not been concluded. Many inhalation toxicologists believe the lung fibrosis and tumors that developed in rats following exposure to carbon black result form massive accumulation of small dust particles that overwhelm the clearance mechanism and produce what is termed "lung overload," an effect considered to be rat specific and not relevant to humans. In addition, based on epidemiological studies, no causal link between carbon black exposure and cancer risk in humans has been demonstrated.

# 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Ecotoxicity Effects: Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewer system.

Other information: Ecological damages are not known or expected under normal use.

These lists are under evaluation by ECHA and may subject to change in the future.

1. REACH obligation:

2.1 Concerning article(s):

Communication:

Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 requires supplier of an article containing a substance meeting the criteria in Article 57 and identified in accordance with Article 59(1) in a concentration above  $0.1\%$  weight by weight (w/w) shall provide the recipient of the article with sufficient information, available to the supplier, to allow safe use of the article including, as a minimum, the name of that substance in the Candidate List.

Notification:

In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, any EU producer or importer of articles shall notify ECHA, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 7, if a substance meets the criteria in Article 57 and is identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of the Regulation, if (a) the substance in the Candidate List is present in those articles in quantities totaling over one tonne per producer or importer per year; and (b) the substance in the Candidate List is present in those articles above a concentration of  $0.1\%$  weight by weight  $(w/w)$ .

SGS adopts the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the definition of an article under REACH unless indicated otherwise. Detail explanation is available at the following link:

# Notes

(1) The table above only shows detected SVHC, and SVHC that below RL are not reported. Please refer to Appendix for the full list of tested SVHC.

(2) RL = Reporting Limit (Test data will be shown if it  $\geq$  RL. RL is not regulatory limit.) ND = Not detected (lower than RL), ND is denoted on the SVHC substance.

(3) * The test result is based on the calculation of selected element(s) and to the worst-case scenario. ** The test result is based on the calculation of selected marker(s) and to the worst-case scenario. For detail information, please refer to the SGS REACH website:

[http://www.sgs.com/en/Consumer-Goods-Retail/Toys-and-Juvenile-Products/Toys/REACH/Management-of-SVHC.aspx](http://www.sgs.com/en/Consumer-Goods-Retail/Toys-and-Juvenile-Products/Toys/REACH/Management-of-SVHC.aspx)

Calculated concentration of boric compounds are based on the total boron for liquid, powder and paste samples and water extractive boron for other samples by ICP-OES.

$\mathsf{RL} = 0.005\%$  is evaluated for element (i.e. cobalt, arsenic, lead, chromium (VI), aluminum, zirconium, boron, strontium, zinc, antimony, titanium, barium and cadmium respectively), except molybdenum  $\mathsf{RL} = 0.0005\%$  , boron  $\mathsf{RL} = 0.0025\%$  (only for Lead bis(tetrafluoroborate)).

(4) § The substance is proposed for the identification as SVHC only where it contains Michler's ketone (CAS Number: 90-94-8) or Michler's base (CAS Number: 101-61-1)  $\geq 0.1\%$  (w/w).
