Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures

Personal precautions

Spilled material is a slipping hazard.

Environmental precautions

Environmental precautions

: Do not discharge to streams, ponds, lakes or sewers.

Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up

Methods for cleaning up

Spills of fine material should be cleaned using gentle sweeping or vacuuming. Cleaning methods (e.g. compressed air) which can generate potentially combustible dust clouds should not be used. Dust deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces, as these may form an explosive mixture if they are released into the atmosphere in sufficient concentration. Use only non-sparking tools.

# SECTION 7: Handling and storage

Precautions for safe handling

Advice on safe handling

: Open container only in well-ventilated area. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Provide appropriate exhaust ventilation at dryers, machinery and at places where dust or volatiles can be generated. Do not breathe dust. Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.

Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities

Requirements for storage areas and containers

Store in a cool, dry place. Keep container closed to prevent contamination. Keep in an area equipped with sprinklers.

# SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection

If sub-section is empty then no values are applicable. For further information on any control parameters provided, please refer to the relevant regulation.

processing this material, use local and/or general exhaust ventilation to maintain the concentration of vapors and fumes below exposure limits.

Wear safety glasses with side shields.

Wear tightly fitting chemical splash goggles and face shield when possibility exists for eye and face contact due to spattering or splashing of molten material.

A full-face mask respirator provides protection from eye irritation.

Hand protection

：

Wear gloves suitable for the task being performed. Leather gloves or a suitable alternative should be worn when handling solid surface. Chemical resistant gloves should be used when handling chemicals. One exception is the use of rotating equipment, where gloves could be caught on the equipment. When handling hot material, use heat resistant gloves.

Skin and body protection

If there is a potential for contact with hot/molten material wear heat resistant clothing and footwear.

Respiratory protection

Additives in this product do not present a respiration hazard unless the product is ground to a powder of respirable size and the dust is inhaled. All dusts are potentially injurious to the respiratory tract if respirable particles are generated and inhaled. A respiratory protection program that meets country requirements must be followed whenever workplace conditions warrant respirator use. Consult the respirator manufacturer to determine the appropriate type of equipment for a given application. Observe respirator use limitations specified by the manufacturer. Use a positive pressure air supplied respirator if exposure levels are not known or there are any other circumstances where air purifying respirators may not provide adequate protection.

# Test Report (SVHC)

No.: SZXPC24003691102

Date: Jul 16, 2024

Page 3 of 15

# Remark :

1. The chemical analysis of specified SVHC is performed by means of currently available analytical techniques against the following SVHC related documents published by ECHA: http://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table These lists are under evaluation by ECHA and may subject to change in the future.

# 2. REACH obligation:

2.1 Concerning article(s):

Communication:

Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 requires supplier of an article containing a substance meeting the criteria in Article 57 and identified in accordance with Article 59(1) in a concentration above  $0.1\%$  weight by weight  $(\mathrm{w / w})$  shall provide the recipient of the article with sufficient information, available to the supplier, to allow safe use of the article including, as a minimum, the name of that substance in the Candidate List.

# Notification:

In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, any EU producer or importer of articles shall notify ECHA, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 7, if a substance meets the criteria in Article 57 and is identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of the Regulation, if (a) the substance in the Candidate List is present in those articles in quantities totaling over one tonne per producer or importer per year; and (b) the substance in the Candidate List is present in those articles above a concentration of  $0.1\%$  weight by weight  $(\mathrm{w / w})$ .

SGS adopts the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the definition of an article under REACH unless indicated otherwise. Detail explanation is available at the following link: http://www.sgs.com/-/media/global/documents/technical-documents/technical-bulletins/sgs-crs-position-statement-on-svhc-in-articles-a4-en-16-06.pdf?la=en

# 2.2 Concerning material(s):

Test results in this report are based on the tested sample. This report refers to testing result of tested sample submitted as homogenous material(s). In case such material is being used to compose an article, the results indicated in this report may not represent SVHC concentration in such article. If this report refers to testing result of composite material group by equal weight proportion, the material in each composite test group may come from more than one article.

If the sample is a substance or mixture, and it directly exports to EU, client has the obligation to comply with the supply chain communication obligation under Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 and the conditions of Authorization of substance of very high concern included in the Annex XIV of the Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006.

# 2.3 Concerning substance and preparation:

If a SVHC is found over  $0.1\%$  (w/w) and/or the specific concentration limit which is set in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and its amendments, client is suggested to prepare a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) against the SVHC to comply with the supply chain communication obligation under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, in which:

- a substance that is classified as hazardous under the CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.
- a mixture that is classified as hazardous under the CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, when it contains a substance with concentration equal to, or greater than the classification limit as set in Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008; or

Test Results: (Substances in the Candidate List of SVHC)

<table><tr><td>Batch</td><td>Substance Name</td><td>CAS No.</td><td>001 Concentration (%)</td><td>RL (%)</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>All tested SVHC in Candidate list</td><td>-</td><td>ND</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

# Notes:

(1) The table above only shows detected SVHC, and SVHC that below RL are not reported. Please refer to Appendix for the full list of tested SVHC.

(2) RL = Reporting Limit (Test data will be shown if it ≥ RL. RL is not regulatory limit.)

ND = Not detected (lower than RL), ND is denoted on the SVHC substance.

(3) * The test result is based on the calculation of selected element(s) and to the worst-case scenario.

The test result is based on the calculation of selected marker(s) and to the worst-case scenario.

Calculated concentration of boric compounds are based on water extractive boron detected by ICP-OES.

Calculated concentration of Barium diboron tetraoxide is based on water extractive boron and barium

detected by ICP-OES.

RL = 0.005% is evaluated for element (i.e. cobalt, arsenic, lead, chromium (VI), aluminum, zirconium,

boron, strontium, zinc, antimony, titanium, barium, cadmium respectively), except molybdenum

RL=0.0005%, boron RL=0.0025% (only for Lead bis(tetrafluoroborate)), fluorine RL=0.050%.

(4) § The substance is proposed for the identification as SVHC only where it contains Michler's ketone (CAS

Number: 90-94-8) or Michler's base (CAS Number: 101-61-1)  $\geq 0.1\%$  (w/w).

(5)  $I =$  Potential SVHC

(6) Composite test has been performed in equal proportion for the components/material per client requested.

And the result is calculated using the minimum sample weight.

Unless otherwise stated, the decision rule for conformity reporting is based on Binary Statement for Simple

Acceptance Rule  $(w = 0)$  stated in ILAC-G8:09/2019.
